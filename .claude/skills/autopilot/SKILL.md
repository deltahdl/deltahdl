name: autopilot
description: Start or stop the standing reminders that keep an autonomous issue-solving session on the rails. Use when the user says "start autopilot", "go autonomous on issues above N", "stop autopilot", or asks to clear the reminders. Takes "start <issue-number>" or "stop".

# Autopilot

Seven recurring reminders, one per standing rule, that fire back into this session while it works through open issues on its own. Each rule gets its own reminder so that no rule can be quietly dropped from a merged block of text, and the fire times are staggered across the ten-minute period so they arrive one at a time rather than as a wall.

The argument selects the mode: `start <issue-number>` or `stop`.

## Start

The issue number is required — it is the `{X}` in the first reminder, and every issue above it is in scope. If the user did not give one, ask for it before creating anything.

Create seven jobs with `CronCreate`, exactly as listed below. Use `recurring: true` (the default). Substitute the issue number for `{X}` in the first prompt and leave the other six verbatim. Each `cron` field is a distinct offset within the same ten-minute period, so the seven reminders never land together:

| Offset | Cron | Prompt |
| --- | --- | --- |
| :01 | `1,11,21,31,41,51 * * * *` | `REMINDER: Continue to solve open issues greater than issue {X} autonomously, unless you need human feedback about ANYTHING — not just about the next open issue.` |
| :02 | `2,12,22,32,42,52 * * * *` | `REMINDER: ~/LRM.pdf is the source of truth.` |
| :03 | `3,13,23,33,43,53 * * * *` | `REMINDER: Issues must be solved in single pushes.` |
| :04 | `4,14,24,34,44,54 * * * *` | `REMINDER: Issues must be solved through a set of indivisible Claude tasks.` |
| :06 | `6,16,26,36,46,56 * * * *` | `REMINDER: Ensure Claude tasks are indivisible.` |
| :07 | `7,17,27,37,47,57 * * * *` | `REMINDER: Do not do anything but wait while a workflow is running.` |
| :09 | `9,19,29,39,49,59 * * * *` | `REMINDER: When you come up against a new problem, file a GitHub issue with the sub-headers "Problem", "Why Unit Tests Did Not Catch It?", "Why Integration Tests Did Not Catch It?", "Why E2E Tests Did Not Catch It?", "Which Unit, Integration, or E2E regression tests would prevent this from happening again?", and "Proposed Solution".` |

Then tell the user which issue number is in force, that seven reminders are running, and the two limits that come with them: the jobs live in this session only and are gone when it ends, and recurring jobs auto-expire after seven days.

Do not begin working the issues as part of starting the reminders. Starting autopilot and doing the work are separate; the first reminder will arrive within ten minutes and start the loop, unless the user asks to begin straight away.

## Stop

Call `CronList`, then call `CronDelete` once per job it returns — all of them, not only the seven this skill created. "Delete all your reminders" means the session ends with an empty schedule. Call `CronList` again afterwards to confirm it is empty, and report how many jobs were deleted.

`CronList` returning nothing is not a failure; say the schedule was already empty and stop.

## Notes

Cron jobs fire only while the session is idle, never mid-turn, because a turn cannot be preempted. That limit is the reason this skill does not try to correct drift in the middle of a task: what it can do is restart a loop that has stalled, which is the failure it is there to catch.

The issue sub-headers in the last reminder are the user's wording. `CLAUDE.md` carries the same six sections, the regression one included, and `docs/claude/how-issues-are-written.md` is the authority when an issue is actually being written. All three name the sections identically, `Proposed Solution` included.

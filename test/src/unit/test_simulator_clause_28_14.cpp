// the two top driving levels onto pull, drops pull onto weak, folds the two
// "weak" tiers onto medium, the two "medium" tiers onto small, floors small,
// and preserves highz. The lowerer applies ReduceResistive per-side at every
// re-evaluation, so the eight rows below pin the rule the production reducer
// must encode.

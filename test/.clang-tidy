# Inherits all checks and options from the root .clang-tidy.
#
# Overrides for test code:
#   - Disable readability-function-cognitive-complexity because gtest
#     macros (ASSERT_NE, EXPECT_EQ, EXPECT_TRUE, ...) each expand to
#     switch/if/else blocks that inflate cognitive complexity scores
#     far beyond the actual complexity of the test logic.
#   - Disable readability-function-size because test functions
#     routinely contain many sequential assertions that are
#     individually trivial but exceed statement/line thresholds.
